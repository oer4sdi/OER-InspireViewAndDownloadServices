# OER SDI4 INSPIRE View And Download Services - Teacher's Guide

## 1. Conceptual Aspects of the Learning Material

This tutorial was developed as a supplementary learning material for lectures/exercises in the subject area of spatial data infrastructures and can be used for blended learning. There are no dependencies on specific courses or course content, so it can be integrated as a learning unit in a wide variety of contexts and can also be used for independent learning.

It is an introductory learning module that should help to better understand what SDIs are and how SDIs present themselves in practice. The chapter "Background" ties in with contents of teaching courses, in which theories and concepts about SDI are taught in more detail. The exercise that follows allows to interact with SDIs and getting familiar with SDI components.

In this tutorial we focus on the special requirements on Inspire view and download services compared to the more general standards of ISO and OGC. Data providers have some degrees of freedom regarding the form they chose for providing view and download services. The open question is: are INSPIRE view and download services implemented in a way which makes data FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable? Answering these questions will help to understand both the rationale behind Inspire and the state of play, which is still a step behind  Inspire's ambitions. 



## 2 Recommendations for the use of the learning material

### 2.1 PDF version

The learning material consists of a PDF file that you can download from the /docs subfolder. As supporting materials, you will find the data of the exercise in the /data subfolder and sample solutions for the questions and tasks in the /sampleSolutions folder.

The PDF document can be used as a digital script or as a printout. You can integrate it - like any other digital material - into your learning management system. 


### 2.2 Ways of using the learning material

Of course, students can simply read the material. However, in doing so, they will also overread a lot of things and miss essential insights that only come from hands-on experience with the topic. 

We have designed the learning material to support active engagement with the learning topic and would highly recommend making use of this:

   a) Ask the students to follow the described workflow themselves, i.e., to search for and find the required data in the data portals and to process them themselves in the described GIS analysis. They can compare the result in all sub-steps with the results of the tutorial.

   b) Ask the students to answer the questions in the CheckYourKnowledge chapter. Discuss these and similar questions with the students.

Sample solutions to the questions and tasks can be found in the "sampleSolutions" subdirectory in this GitHub repository.
