### Target Audience and Prerequisites

This tutorial is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their understanding of Spatial Information Infrastructures. We assume that you have some basic knowledge about spatial data, QGIS and Python. In this case you will need about 30 minutes to use this tutorial.


### How to use the OER Module

The OER(In Progress) is implemented as an [H5P](https://h5p.org/) module that can be downloaded and embedded into any H5P runtime environment, such as:
- Learning management systems based on Moodle or Ilias
- H5P editing environments such as the [H5P Official Editor](https://h5p.org/) or the lightweight [LUMI H5P editor](https://lumi.education/)
- Content managament systems such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) with "H5P" plugin installed

Simply download just the H5P file, upload it to one of the environments and use it from there...

Alternatively you can use the Document " OER_INSPIRE View And Downloads services.pdf" from the PDF folder which has the same content.
