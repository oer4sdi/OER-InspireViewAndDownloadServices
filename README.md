# How to Use INSPIRE View and Download Services

This repository contains the tutorial “ INSPIRE View and Download Services ” which is available for reuse as an Open Educational Resource (OER). 

INSPIRE stands for “Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe”. The European INSPIRE legislation requires public sector institutions in the member states to provide access to spatial data via so-called view services and download services. INSPIRE also provides technical recommendations on how these services can be implemented on the basis of international standards such as classic OGC Web Map Services (WMS) and OGC Web Feature Services (WFS) or the newer OGC API type of services. 


In this technical tutorial, we will explore how to work with INSPIRE view and download services. Learning objectives are:

-	Understanding the characteristics of INSPIRE view and download services.
-   Gaining practical experience in working with these resources

## Content Structure

The tutorial is structured as follows: 

-	Background
    - Overview on INSPIRE - motivation, legal framework, technical components
    - INSPIRE data themes 
    - INSPIRE view services
    - INSPIRE download services
-	Practical example on working with INSPIRE view and download services
    - Use case
    - Finding INSPIRE view and download services
    - Using INSPIRE view services
    - Using INSPIRE download services
-	Summary and Discussion   
- Questions and tasks


## Target Audience and Prerequisites

This tutorial is designed for students and professionals who want to improve their understanding of Spatial Information Infrastructures. We assume that you have some basic knowledge about spatial data, QGIS and Python. In this case you will need about 30 minutes to use this tutorial.


## How to use the OER Module

The OER(In Progress) is implemented as an [H5P](https://h5p.org/) module that can be downloaded and embedded into any H5P runtime environment, such as:
- Learning management systems based on Moodle or Ilias
- H5P editing environments such as the [H5P Official Editor](https://h5p.org/) or the lightweight [LUMI H5P editor](https://lumi.education/)
- Content managament systems such as [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) with "H5P" plugin installed

Simply download just the H5P file, upload it to one of the environments and use it from there...

Alternatively you can use the Document " OER_INSPIRE View And Downloads services.pdf" from the PDF folder which has the same content.
